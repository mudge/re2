# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Older versions are detailed as [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/mudge/re2/releases) for this project.

## [2.6.0.rc1] - 2023-12-13
### Added
- Add precompiled native gem for Ruby 3.3.0-rc1.

## [2.5.0] - 2023-12-05
### Added
- Add a new matching interface that more closely resembles the underlying RE2
  library's: `RE2::Regexp#full_match?`, `RE2::Regexp#partial_match?` for
  matching without extracting submatches and `RE2::Regexp#full_match` and
  `RE2::Regexp#partial_match` for extracting submatches. The latter two are
  built on the existing `RE2::Regexp#match` method which now exposes more of
  RE2's general matching interface by accepting new `anchor`, `startpos` and
  `endpos` (where supported) arguments.

### Changed
- Overhaul much of the documentation to better explain the library and more
  closely match the underlying RE2 library's interface, primarily promoting
  the new full and partial matching APIs.
- Remove workarounds for building Abseil on Windows now that pkgconf 2.1.0 has
  been released.

## [2.4.3] - 2023-11-22
### Fixed
- Restore support for compiling the gem with gcc 7.3 (as used on Amazon Linux
  2), fixing the "non-trivial designated initializers not supported" error
  introduced in version 2.4.0. Thanks to @stanhu for reporting this bug.

## [2.4.2] - 2023-11-17
### Changed
- Improve the reported consuming memory size of RE2::Regexp, RE2::Set and
  RE2::Scanner objects.

## [2.4.1] - 2023-11-12
### Changed
- Improve the reported consuming memory size of RE2::MatchData objects. Thanks
  to @byroot again for suggesting a better way to calculate this.

## [2.4.0] - 2023-11-11
### Added
- Improve garbage collection and support compaction in newer versions of Ruby.
  Thanks to @byroot for contributing this by switching to Ruby's TypedData API.

### Changed
- No longer needlessly return copies of frozen strings passed to
  `RE2::Regexp#match` and return the original instead.

## [2.3.0] - 2023-10-31
### Changed
- Upgrade the bundled version of RE2 to 2023-11-01.

## [2.2.0] - 2023-10-23
### Changed
- Upgrade the bundled version of Abseil to 20230802.1.
- Upgrade MiniPortile to 2.8.5 which significantly reduces the size of the
  precompiled native gems due to its switch to build Abseil in Release mode.

## [2.1.3] - 2023-09-23
### Fixed
- Fixed memory leaks reported by
  [ruby_memcheck](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby_memcheck) when rewinding an
  `RE2::Scanner` and when passing invalid input to `RE2::Regexp#scan`,
  `RE2::Regexp#initialize`, `RE2.Replace`, `RE2.GlobalReplace` and
  `RE2::Set#add`. Thanks to @peterzhu2118 for maintaining ruby_memcheck and
  their assistance in finding the source of these leaks.

## [2.1.2] - 2023-09-20
### Fixed
- Removed use of a C++17 extension from the gem to restore support for users
  compiling against system libraries with older C compilers.

## [2.1.1] - 2023-09-18
### Fixed
- Worked around a deprecation warning re the use of ANYARGS when compiling
  against recent Ruby versions.

### Changed
- Various internal C++ style improvements to reduce unnecessary memory usage
  when accessing named capturing groups.

## [2.1.0] - 2023-09-16
### Fixed
- As RE2 only supports UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encodings, fix an inconsistency
  when using string patterns with `RE2.Replace` and `RE2.GlobalReplace` where
  the result would match the encoding of the pattern rather than UTF-8 which is
  what RE2 will use. This behaviour and limitation is now documented on all
  APIs that produce string results.

### Added
- The `RE2::Set` API now accepts anything that can be coerced to a string where
  previously only strings were permitted, e.g. `RE2::Set#add`,
  `RE2::Set#match`.
- Added the licences of all vendored dependencies: RE2 and Abseil.
- Document the behaviour of `RE2::Regexp#match` when given a pattern with no
  capturing groups: it will return true or false whether there was a match or
  not rather than a `RE2::MatchData` instance.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-13
### Added
- The gem now comes bundled with the underlying RE2 library and its dependency,
  Abseil. Installing the gem will compile those dependencies automatically. As
  this can take a while, precompiled native gems are available for Linux,
  Windows and macOS. (Thanks to Stan Hu for contributing this.)

### Changed
- By default, the gem will use its own bundled version of RE2 rather than
  looking for the library on the system. To opt back into that behaviour, pass
  `--enable-system-libraries` when installing. (Thanks to Stan Hu for
  contributing this.)

### Removed
- Due to the new dependency on MiniPortile2, the gem no longer supports Ruby
  versions older than 2.6.

## [2.0.0.beta2] - 2023-09-10
### Added
- Restored support for Ruby 2.6.

### Changed
- Upgraded the vendored version of RE2 to 2023-09-01.

### Fixed
- When using the Ruby platform gem (skipping the precompiled, native gems) and
  opting out of the vendored dependencies in favour of a system install of
  RE2 with `--enable-system-libraries`, the gem will now compile correctly
  against the library if it is installed in Ruby's `exec_prefix` directory.
  (Thanks to Stan Hu.)

## [2.0.0.beta1] - 2023-09-08
### Added
- The gem now comes bundled with the underlying RE2 library and its dependency,
  Abseil. Installing the gem will compile those dependencies automatically. As
  this can take a while, precompiled native gems are available for Linux,
  Windows and macOS. (Thanks to Stan Hu for contributing this.)

### Changed
- By default, the gem will use its own bundled version of RE2 rather than
  looking for the library on the system. To opt back into that behaviour, pass
  `--enable-system-libraries` when installing. (Thanks to Stan Hu for
  contributing this.)

### Removed
- Due to the new dependency on MiniPortile2, the gem no longer supports Ruby
  versions older than 2.7.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-07-04
### Added
- Added support for libre2.11 (thanks to Stan Hu for contributing this)

## [1.6.0] - 2022-10-22
### Added
- Added RE2::MatchData#deconstruct and RE2::MatchData#deconstruct_keys so they
  can be used with Ruby pattern matching

## [1.5.0] - 2022-10-16
### Added
- Added RE2::Set for simultaneously searching a collection of patterns

## [1.4.0] - 2021-03-29
### Fixed
- Fixed a crash when using RE2::Scanner#scan with an invalid regular expression
  (thanks to Sergio Medina for reporting this)
- Fixed RE2::Regexp#match raising a NoMemoryError instead of an ArgumentError
  when given a negative number of matches

## [1.3.0] - 2021-03-12
### Added
- Add Homebrew's prefix on Apple Silicon and /usr as fallback locations
  searched when looking for the underlying re2 library if not found in
  /usr/local

## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-18
### Changed
- Stop using the now-deprecated utf8 API and re-implement it in terms of the
  encoding API in order to support both existing and upcoming releases of re2

## [1.1.1] - 2017-07-24
### Fixed
- Ensure that any compilers passed via the CC and CXX environment variables are
  used throughout the compilation process including both the final Makefile and
  any preceding checks

## [1.1.0] - 2017-07-23
### Fixed
- Fixed RE2::Scanner not advancing when calling scan with an empty pattern or
  pattern with empty capturing groups (thanks to Stan Hu for reporting this)

### Added
- Added eof? to RE2::Scanner to detect when the input has been fully consumed by
  matches (used internally by the fixed scan)
- Added support for specifying the C and C++ compiler using the standard CC and
  CXX environment variables when installing the gem

## [1.0.0] - 2016-11-14
### Added
- Added support for versions of the underlying re2 library that require C++11
  compiler support

## [0.7.0] - 2015-01-25
### Added
- Added RE2::MatchData#begin and RE2::MatchData#end for finding the offset of
  matches in your searches

## [0.6.1] - 2014-10-25
### Fixed
- Fix crash when non-strings are passed to match

## [0.6.0] - 2014-02-01
### Added
- Added RE2::Regexp#scan which returns a new RE2::Scanner instance for
  incrementally scanning a string for matches

### Removed
- Methods that altered strings in place are gone: re2_sub! and re2_gsub!

### Changed
- RE2.Replace and RE2.GlobalReplace now return new strings rather than modifying
  their input

### Fixed
- In Ruby 1.9.2 and later, re2 will now set the correct encoding for strings
